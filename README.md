# terjol
motherfucking terjol what the fuck
***
TerJol is a port of [TerCol](https://github.com/Butterroach/tercol) for Java.

THIS IS MY 3RD EVER JAVA THING GOD PLEASE SPARE ME

# Differences:
- No aliases at all

# How to use
1. Get the terjol.java file in src/terjol.
2. Run `javac terjol.java`.
3. Put the new `terjol.class` file in a directory named `terjol` in the same directory as your Java program.
4. You should be able to import it in your code using `import terjol.terjol` now!

If it doesn't work then try using OpenJDK 21. If that doesn't work I'm probably just stupid (open an issue or fix it for me and open a PR :3 :3 :3 pls fix it for me i am so clueless).
